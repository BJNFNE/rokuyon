# rokuyon
An experimental N64 emulator

### Overview
My main goal with rokuyon is to learn about the Nintendo 64 hardware so I can write homebrew like [sodium64](https://github.com/Hydr8gon/sodium64). If it ends up being more than that... I wouldn't mind making a modern, accurate N64 emulator with built-in software/hardware rendering and no messy plugins.
