# rokuyon
An experimental N64 emulator

### Overview
My main goal with rokuyon is to learn about the Nintendo 64 hardware so I can write homebrew like [sodium64](https://github.com/Hydr8gon/sodium64). If it ends up being more than that... I wouldn't mind making a modern, accurate N64 emulator with built-in software/hardware rendering and no messy plugins.

### Downloads
rokuyon is available for Linux, macOS, Windows, and Switch. Automatic builds are provided via GitHub Actions; you can download them on the [releases page](https://github.com/Hydr8gon/rokuyon/releases).

### Usage
Although still in early stages, rokuyon should be plug-and-play with any NTSC ROMs in big-endian format. Performance will be bad and there will be plenty of issues. Important features such as control remapping aren't implemented yet. At this stage, rokuyon should be considered a curiosity and not a dedicated emulator for playing games.
